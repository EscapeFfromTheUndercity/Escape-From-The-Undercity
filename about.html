        <p>It's coming back to H now..... His girlfriend, Jane, told him, if  they were to make the next step, he needed to make that appointment to see the City Doctor.  H held deep misgivings about the City they lived in, suspicions, and that negativity was affecting their relationship.  H did the right think - he sought professional help.  Now he wakes up in a room, in a pile of dead bodies, with killer robots entering to clean up the mess.   What now?   Where did it all go wrong?  Whatfore the Hippocratic Oath?  And why did he listen to Jane?
