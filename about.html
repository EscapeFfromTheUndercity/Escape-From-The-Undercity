      <p>It's coming back to H.....</p>
      <p>Jane, told him, if they were to make the next step, he needed to make that appointment to see the City Doctor. H harboured deep misgivings about the City they lived in, and the society in general, and that negativity was affecting their relationship. H did the right thing; he sought professional help. Now he wakes up in a room, in a pile of dead bodies, with killer robots entering to clean up the remains.</p>
      <p>Now you're getting it H! And whatfore the Hippocratic Oath? And why did I listen to Jane!!!</p>
      <p>Award Winning Comix Artist Richard Cowdry, with Peter Lally, bring you the future....NOW!!!</p>
