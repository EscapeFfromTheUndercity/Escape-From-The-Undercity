      It's coming back to H..... 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane, told him, if  they were to make the next step, he needed to make that appointment to see the City Doctor.  H harboured deep misgivings about the City they lived in, and the society in general, and that negativity was affecting their relationship.  H did the right thing; he sought professional help.  Now he wakes up in a room, in a pile of dead bodies, with killer robots entering to clean up the remains.  Now you know H.   Whatfore the Hippocratic Oath?  And why did I listen to Jane!!!
